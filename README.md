# MultiSpecMCMC
The code implement Adaptive Bayesian power spectrum analysis of multivariate nonstationary time series. Simuluated data are also avaiable in this repository.

The demo code include: demo_abrupt_changing (for time-varying spectrum with abrupt changes) and demo_slow_varying (for time-varying spectrum with slow-varying changes).
